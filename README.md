# ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Sales Agent

A complete end-to-end AI agent that predicts the success probability of sales deals, recommends the next best action, and generates personalized follow-up emails using Hugging Face Inference API.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… **Deal Success Prediction**: ML model trained on CRM-style sales data to classify potential deal outcomes.
- âœ… **Action Recommendation**: Rule-based engine suggests the next best action based on probability and recency.
- âœ… **AI Email Generator**: Uses Hugging Face's LLMs to auto-generate personalized follow-up emails.
- âœ… **Interactive Dashboard**: Built with Streamlit for fast prototyping and user interaction.
- âœ… **Modular API**: FastAPI backend (optional phase) to decouple UI from logic.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. User fills lead details in dashboard
2. Trained model predicts deal success probability
3. Rule engine recommends action (e.g., "Arrange Demo")
4. LLM generates follow-up email.
